This repo contain various python labs exercises done by me while enrolled in a coding bootcamp. This file contains description of some of the labs that challenged the most.

Automated Readability Index:
compute the ARI for a given book. The automated readability index (ARI) is a formula for computing the U.S. grade level for a given block of text. The score is computed by multiplying the number of characters divided by the number of words by 4.71, adding the number of words divided by the number of sentences multiplied by 0.5, and subtracting 21.43.

Blackjack Advice:
A python program to give basic blackjack playing advice during a game by asking the player for cards. First, ask the user for three playing cards (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, or K). Then, figure out the point value of each card individually. Number cards are worth their number, all face cards are worth 10.


Count Words:
A python module to analyze a given text file containing a book for its vocabulary frequency and display the most frequent words to the user in the termina

Credit Card Validation:
A function which returns whether a string containing a credit card number is valid as a boolean.

Dad Joke API:
Uses the Dad Joke API to get a dad joke and display it to the user.

Rot Cipher:
Write a program that prompts the user for a string, and encodes it with ROT13. For each character, find the corresponding character, add it to an output string. Notice that there are 26 letters in the English language, so encryption is the same as decryption.
